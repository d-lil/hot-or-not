The -beautiful- background I made myself, I probably should have linked the sources from the stock images I used to smash this beauty together, but I cannot remember the locations for them.

The banner of gradient colors I did snag the link for, though. I did flip the image horizontally to match the flow of cool to warm colors I used in the background pic.

Also, I got stuck with the page adding icons to the icons already existing so I got some feedback from Ben Sboto that he cleared his card elements each time. I used that idea to find a way to remove all image elements already existing on the page each time the function to pull weather data was run.
